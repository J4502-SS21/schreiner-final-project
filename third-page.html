  <h2> A 2020 overview </h2>
<p class="therapy"> While mental health is important to consider in everyday life, it’s become a larger problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm">The CDC released a statement</a> that says, in June 2020, U.S. adults reported elevated adverse mental health conditions associated with COVID-19 and younger adults experienced disproportionately worse mental health outcomes, and higher substance use and elevated suicidal thoughts. This shows that mental health is more of a priority now more than ever. </p>
<p class="therapy"> According to the CDC report, as of late June 40%, 31% of adults reported increased symptoms of anxiety and depression and 11% considered suicide. </p>

<h2> Online therapy </h2>
<p class="online"> It hasn’t been all bad, however. The pandemic paved the way for telehealth to take over, and there’s a good chance it’s here to stay. Online therapy has allowed for increased access, reduced travel costs and flexibility that in-person therapy was not able to do. In fact, there have been studies that prove some patients prefer telehealth services. In an article from <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2021/01/trends-online-therapy">the American Psychological Association,</a> Jeanine Turner, professor at Georgetown University, said telehealth is here to stay. </p>
<p class="online">“Last year, within weeks, the system had to absorb all the challenges of wide-scale adoption,” says Turner. “Now, it’s taken off—and there will be no going back.”</p>
