<h1> Why is mental health important? </h1>

<h2> Importance of mental health </h2>
<p> According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/learn/index.htm">the CDC</a>, mental and physical health are equally important in terms of overall health. Mental illness, specifically depression, can increase the risks for other physical health problems such as strokes and heart disease. It's important to note that mental health can change over time, so it's never too late to take steps to improve it. </p>
