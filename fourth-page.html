<h1> Mental health and social media </h1>


<h2> The importance </h2>
<p id="pg4intro">While social media in and of itself is not a bad thing-- it can be used to keep in touch long distance, get news, see what’s going on with old friends-- too much social media can have adverse mental health impacts. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26783723/">A study from PubMed.gov</a> found that higher social media usage is more likely to be associated with depression in young adults. Studies such as this one suggest that, while social media can be a helpful tool, passive social media users experience better mental health than active social media users. </p>

<h2> The social media detox </h2>
<p> A social media detox is intentionally abstaining from social media to improve one’s mental health. The amount of time one does a social media detox for is up to them, but it’s typically completed in 30 days. The goal of a social media detox is to gain back some of the mental energy one expels each time they visit a social media platform. <a href="https://declutterthemind.com/blog/social-media-detox/">One article</a> suggests that a social media detox allows a person to clear their mind, take back control of their digital habits, gain more free time and experience better mornings and less anxiety. </p>
<p><a href="https://declutterthemind.com/blog/social-media-detox/">Steps for doing</a> a social media detox are pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p><strong>Tell people</strong> what you're going to be doing so it’s easier to hold yourself accountable.</p>
<p><strong>Plan </strong>what you’ll do doing your detox instead of spending time on social media. </p>
<p><strong>Keep in touch</strong> with your friends in family during the detox so you’ll still feel in the loop!</p>
<p><strong>Start</strong> the detox!</p>
